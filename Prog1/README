\cf2 \strokec2 1. The attributes of the\cf0 \strokec0  
\f2 \cf2 \strokec2 DList\cf0 \strokec0  
\f1 \cf2 \strokec2 class and why templates are being used\cf0 \strokec0 \
\cf2 \strokec2 2. A description of each of the operations of the 
\f2 DList\cf0 \strokec0  
\f1 \cf2 \strokec2 class\cf0 \strokec0 \
\cf2 \strokec2 3. The role of the Move to the Front Algorithm\cf0 \strokec0 \
\cf2 \strokec2 4. A description of the main algorithm followed by the client program\cf0 \cb4 \strokec0 \
 \
\
1. The attributes of the DList are used when making a doubly linked list. A doubly linked list links elements two ways, backwards and forwards, to their back and next element. Templates are used in this class, that way we can have any data type in the nodes. \
\
2. With this DList class, you can insert an item at the head or back of the list, access any existing item and move it to the front, delete any existing item in the list, or print the list out and its length. \
\
3. The 
\fs35\fsmilli17933 \cf2 \cb3 \outl0\strokewidth0 Move to the Front Algorithm allows the user to make an item more accessible by moving it to the front. This done by having 3 instances. Removing a node at the beginning, the middle, and at the end. First you must find the item that\'92s to be deleted and delete and successfully relink the rest of the items back. Then you use the insertHead method to move it to the front by copying it. \
\
4. The main algorithm involves being able to take a node located anywhere in the list and be able to delete and or move it to front without losing any links along the way. }
